# BASE-Web-System

_From around 2007, provided for historical purposes only_

An old development snapshot (__1 Library Only__) of a multi tenant website system I developed for use with clients - Think along the lines of SharePoint and similar systems.

It was actually quite advanced for it's time.

I also created BASELite, a very light weight version of BASE for rapid WYSIWYG creation of simple sites.

# Notes

When I look back on this I think to myself, damn, I (we) put a whole lot of effort into this one! But I also look at it and say EWWWWWWWW. 

Some great stuff in here and also some bad such as poor design/architecture decisions and rookie mistakes! The years sure do make you wiser! 

Two members of my team contributed to BASE - Evan Weatherhead and Steve Arbour.
