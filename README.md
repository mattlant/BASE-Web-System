# BASE-Web-System

_From around 2007, provided for historical purposes only_

An old development snapshot (1 Library Only) of a multi tenant website system I developed for use with clients - Think along the lines of SharePoint and similar systems.

## Notes

When I look back on this I think to myself, damn, I put a whole lot of effort into this one! But I also look at it and say EWWWWWWWW. 

Some great stuff in here and also some bad design decisions.
